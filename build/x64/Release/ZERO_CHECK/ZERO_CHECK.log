  CMake is re-running because C:/Users/Rongxing/Desktop/ETH/CG/nori/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp is out-of-date.

    is newer than 'C:/Users/Rongxing/Desktop/ETH/CG/nori/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp.depend'

  CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:2 (cmake_minimum_required):
    Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
    CMake.
  
    Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
    CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.
