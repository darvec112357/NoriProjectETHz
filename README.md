# Nori Project 2022

For the ETHz's Computer Graphics 2022 coursework, we were tasked with rendering an Image based on Ray Tracing. More specifically, we designed a workspace that could eventually render the scene of Minas Tirith, the Tower of Guard, formerly known as Minas Anor, was the capital city of Gondor from TA 1640 onward. It is essentially a fictional city of Gondor Kingdom in J. R. R. Tolkien's writings. For the layout of the city, a spur of rock, whose summit was level with the city's uppermost tier, jutted out from the front of the city in an easterly direction, dividing all but the first and seventh levels in two. The rock out of the city is really eye-catching and can be regarded a classic out-of-place design from Tolkien's richful imagnination. Here in this project, we want to eventually render the front side of Minas Tirith alongwith the Mindolluin Mountain of which the city itself lay on the hill, and the Pelennor Fields, a large field surrounding (mostly to the east) Minas Tirith.
